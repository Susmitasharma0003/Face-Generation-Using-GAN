# Face-Generation-Using-GAN
This project implements a DCGAN in TensorFlow/Keras to generate realistic faces from the CelebA dataset. Using 64Ã—64 images, the generator learns from noise while the discriminator detects fakes. Training progress is visualized, showing how image quality improves across epochs.
